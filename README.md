# Linear-Model-uisng-homolog-survey-data
The binding affinity between the ACE2 and RBD interactions is predicted by a linear regression model trained by the Sklearn model. The actual score is represented by the y value, while the form of the 1x2560 matrix is represented by the x value (ACE2 and RBD). The ESM model's 33 (final) tensor is where the x value is taken out of.
